2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net f3/b_reg is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin f3/a_i_1/O, cell f3/a_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT f3/a_i_1 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    c/temp_reg[0] {FDRE}
    c/temp_reg[1] {FDRE}
    c/temp_reg[2] {FDRE}
    c/temp_reg[3] {FDRE}
    c/temp_reg[4] {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
